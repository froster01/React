WELCOME TO TASK 3: SIMPLE DRAWER MENU COMPONENT

OBJECTIVES:
- Implement a basic drawer navigation
- DrawerMenu component
- Add multiple screens and navigate using the drawer menu

TASKS:
1. Setup Drawer Navigation:

    Install the necessary packages for drawer navigation:
        - npm install @react-navigation/drawer
        - npm install react-native-gesture-handler react-native-reanimated

    Follow the setup instructions for react-native-reanimated if needed

    If module above triggered any error while installing, please read the official documentation react native on this link, https://reactnavigation.org/docs/drawer-navigator/

    Do let me know if your DrawerMenu needs props


2. Create Drawer Navigator Component:

    Inside src folder, create a new folder 'component'
    Name it as DrawerMenu.tsx
    Include the UI or Text Age and Address


3. Create Additional Screens:

    In the screens folder, create two new screens: Age.tsx and Address.tsx
    Add basic content to these screens to display their names


4. Configure Drawer Navigator:

    Ensure that the drawer menu can be opened and closed and that navigation between all screens works correctly


5. Integrate Drawer Navigator with Stack Navigator:

    In StackNavigatorRoot.tsx, add the DrawerNavigator as a screen in the stack navigator. You can refer to my example how i add DrawerRoot function in navigators.png



CHALLENGES AHEAD - You need to research how to create your own component DrawerMenu and use it inside DrawerRoot function


GOODLUCK AIMAN!
